Data Science Internship Projects - EDA, Sentiment Analysis, Fraud Detection, and Regression

This repository contains solutions to four key data science tasks completed during my internship:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization of the Titanic dataset

Text Sentiment Analysis using IMDB Reviews

Fraud Detection System with Credit Card Fraud dataset

House Price Prediction using the Boston Housing dataset

Each task demonstrates different aspects of data science including data cleaning, visualization, machine learning model implementation, and evaluation. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks,  datasets, and comprehensive documentation.
