# Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset

## Overview

This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations on a real-world dataset to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships between features.

## Project Steps

1. Data Loading: Read the dataset from CSV using pandas.

2. Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values (if any).

Correct data types and remove duplicates.

3. Exploratory Analysis:

Summary statistics (.describe()).

Distribution plots (histograms, KDE).

Boxplots to detect outliers.

4. Feature Relationships:

Correlation matrix and heatmap.

Scatter plots for feature pairs.

5. Visualization:

Bar charts, pie charts for categorical distributions.

Line plots (if time-series data present).

Custom plots using matplotlib and seaborn.

## How to Run

1. Open TASK 1 EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset notebook.ipynb in Jupyter.

2. Ensure required libraries are installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

3. Run each cell sequentially.

## Observations

Key distributions (e.g., skewness in feature X).

Significant correlations (e.g., feature A vs. B has strong positive correlation).

Identified outliers in feature C that may require handling in downstream tasks.

High-level takeaways that inform subsequent modeling steps.
